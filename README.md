# Space Haven Mods

This is a collection of mods I use for customizing [Space Haven by Bugbyte](http://bugbyte.fi/spacehaven/), a pixel art styled retro spaceship colony sim.

It is **not associated with Bugbyte or Space Haven in any way** other than that it modifies some aspects of the game.

All of these mods require [the unofficial mod loader](https://github.com/Tahvohck/spacehaven-modloader) to use them in game.
